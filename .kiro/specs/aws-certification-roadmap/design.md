## Correctness Properties

*A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true across all valid executions of a system—essentially, a formal statement about what the system should do. Properties serve as the bridge between human-readable specifications and machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.*

Based on the prework analysis of acceptance criteria, the following properties ensure system correctness:

### Property 1: Input Validation Consistency
*For any* user input (certification selection, experience years, skill ratings), the system should validate against defined constraints and accept only values within specified ranges or enums.
**Validates: Requirements 1.2, 1.3, 2.3**

### Property 2: Service Categorization Accuracy
*For any* AWS service category selection, all displayed services should belong to that category according to official AWS service classifications.
**Validates: Requirements 2.2**

### Property 3: Skill Assessment Prepopulation Logic
*For any* combination of user role, experience years, and active certifications, the prepopulated skill ratings should reflect logical proficiency levels based on role-specific service usage patterns.
**Validates: Requirements 2.4**

### Property 4: Data Persistence Round-Trip
*For any* user data (profile, skill assessments, roadmaps), saving then retrieving should return equivalent data with proper versioning and timestamps.
**Validates: Requirements 2.5, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3**

### Property 5: AI Analysis Completeness
*For any* completed user profile and skill assessment, the AI analysis should generate knowledge gaps, focus areas, and specific recommendations for all assessed service categories.
**Validates: Requirements 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5**

### Property 6: Focus Area Prioritization Logic
*For any* set of identified knowledge gaps and certification requirements, focus areas should be prioritized by exam weightings combined with user proficiency gaps, with critical gaps ranked highest.
**Validates: Requirements 3.4, 4.2**

### Property 7: Roadmap Structure Completeness
*For any* generated learning roadmap, it should include structured learning plans, timeline estimates, resource links, and customization options based on official exam guides.
**Validates: Requirements 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5**

### Property 8: Authentication Flow Security
*For any* user access attempt, unauthenticated requests should redirect to OIDC provider, successful authentication should create secure sessions, and logout should invalidate all tokens.
**Validates: Requirements 5.1, 5.2, 5.3**

### Property 9: Data Encryption Coverage
*For any* sensitive user data, it should be encrypted both at rest in DynamoDB and in transit through all API communications.
**Validates: Requirements 5.4**

### Property 10: Session Management Lifecycle
*For any* user session, it should implement proper timeout mechanisms, token refresh capabilities, and maintain consistency across device switches.
**Validates: Requirements 5.5, 6.4**

### Property 11: Responsive Design Adaptation
*For any* device type and screen size, the interface should adapt layouts, input methods, and component spacing appropriately for optimal user experience.
**Validates: Requirements 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5**

### Property 12: Error Handling Resilience
*For any* data operation failure, the system should implement proper error handling, retry mechanisms, and graceful degradation without data loss.
**Validates: Requirements 7.4**

### Property 13: Documentation Source Authenticity
*For any* learning resource or certification information, it should reference current official AWS documentation and include links to authentic AWS training materials.
**Validates: Requirements 9.1, 9.2, 9.3**

### Property 14: Documentation Freshness Maintenance
*For any* recommendation update or exam requirement change, the system should refresh documentation data and adapt roadmaps to maintain accuracy.
**Validates: Requirements 9.4, 9.5**

### Property 15: Performance Response Times
*For any* user operation (application load, skill assessment processing, roadmap generation), response times should meet specified performance thresholds (3s, 10s, 15s respectively).
**Validates: Requirements 10.1, 10.2, 10.3**

## Error Handling

### Error Classification

**Client Errors (4xx):**
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input data or malformed requests
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication tokens
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions for requested operation
- `404 Not Found`: Requested resource does not exist
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

**Server Errors (5xx):**
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Unexpected server-side failures
- `502 Bad Gateway`: Upstream service failures (Bedrock, AgentCore)
- `503 Service Unavailable`: Temporary service unavailability
- `504 Gateway Timeout`: Request timeout from upstream services

### Error Handling Strategies

#### Lambda Function Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  // Business logic
  const result = await processUserProfile(event);
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify(result)
  };
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    return {
      statusCode: 400,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        error: 'Validation failed',
        details: error.message
      })
    };
  }
  
  if (error instanceof AuthenticationError) {
    return {
      statusCode: 401,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        error: 'Authentication required'
      })
    };
  }
  
  // Log unexpected errors
  console.error('Unexpected error:', error);
  
  return {
    statusCode: 500,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      error: 'Internal server error',
      requestId: context.requestId
    })
  };
}
```

#### DynamoDB Error Handling
- **Conditional Check Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff
- **Provisioned Throughput Exceeded**: Implement request throttling and queuing
- **Item Not Found**: Return appropriate 404 responses
- **Transaction Conflicts**: Retry with jitter to avoid thundering herd

#### Bedrock/AgentCore Error Handling
- **Model Throttling**: Implement exponential backoff with jitter
- **Model Errors**: Fallback to alternative models or cached responses
- **Timeout Errors**: Extend timeout for complex analyses or return partial results
- **Invalid Input**: Validate and sanitize inputs before sending to models

#### Frontend Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Display user-friendly messages with retry options
- **Session Expiration**: Automatic redirect to authentication flow
- **Validation Errors**: Inline field-level error messages
- **Loading States**: Progress indicators for long-running operations

### Retry Mechanisms

**Exponential Backoff Configuration:**
- Initial delay: 100ms
- Maximum delay: 30 seconds
- Maximum attempts: 3
- Jitter: ±25% randomization

**Idempotency:**
- All API operations implement idempotency keys
- DynamoDB conditional writes prevent duplicate records
- Client-side request deduplication for user actions

### Monitoring and Alerting

**CloudWatch Metrics:**
- Lambda function errors and duration
- API Gateway 4xx/5xx error rates
- DynamoDB throttling events
- Bedrock model invocation failures

**CloudWatch Alarms:**
- Error rate exceeds 5% threshold
- P99 latency exceeds performance targets
- DynamoDB consumed capacity approaching limits
- Lambda concurrent execution approaching limits

**X-Ray Tracing:**
- End-to-end request tracing
- Service map visualization
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error root cause analysis

## Testing Strategy

### Overview

The testing strategy employs a dual approach combining unit tests for specific examples and edge cases with property-based tests for universal correctness properties. This comprehensive approach ensures both concrete functionality and general system behavior are validated.

### Property-Based Testing

**Framework Selection:**
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check) - Mature PBT library with excellent TypeScript support
- **Python**: [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/) - Industry-standard PBT framework with rich generator ecosystem

**Configuration:**
- Minimum 100 iterations per property test
- Deterministic seed for reproducible failures
- Shrinking enabled for minimal counterexamples
- Timeout: 60 seconds per property

**Property Test Tagging:**
Each property test must include a comment referencing its design property:
```typescript
// Feature: aws-certification-roadmap, Property 1: Input Validation Consistency
test('validates all user inputs against defined constraints', () => {
  fc.assert(
    fc.property(
      fc.record({
        certification: fc.constantFrom(...Object.values(CertificationType)),
        experienceYears: fc.integer({ min: 0, max: 50 }),
        skillRating: fc.integer({ min: 1, max: 5 })
      }),
      (input) => {
        const result = validateUserInput(input);
        expect(result.isValid).toBe(true);
      }
    ),
    { numRuns: 100 }
  );
});
```

### Unit Testing

**Focus Areas:**
- Specific examples demonstrating correct behavior
